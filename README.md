# AP-Computer-Science
Was intended to be a collection of what I did in AP Computer Science
The actual files were deleted when I attempted to transfer them from the school's online drive.

Concepts covered: 
- Introduction to data structures (Arrays, Lists, briefly Linked-Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- Search Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge, Bubble)

Most notable project: 
Carcassonne
- Given a set of carcassonne tiles with each edge being one of three different variety: a plain, road, or city
- For tiles to be placed next to each other, the edges have to match
- Used recursion and backtracking to place a shuffled bag of tiles in a valid 5 x 5 grid from the standard starting tile.
